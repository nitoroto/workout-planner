This repository contains the core server component of a workout planner application, implemented in Node.js using the Express framework. It establishes a robust backend service that initializes an Express server, tailored to handle fitness planning and tracking functionalities. Key features of this server include middleware configurations for parsing JSON formatted requests and enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to support interactions from different client-side origins. It defines essential endpoints for user authentication processes, workout schedule management, and efficient retrieval of workout data, ensuring a seamless and secure user experience. Moreover, the server is equipped with comprehensive error handling mechanisms to catch and log exceptions, maintaining the application's integrity and reliability. This implementation lays a solid foundation for building a full-fledged workout planner application that is both flexible and scalable.
